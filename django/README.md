# Client-side encryption, Django, PostgreSQL

Django web application with client-side encryption (AcraWriter), decryption on AcraServer, PostgreSQL

Follow [Integrating AcraServer into infrastructure guide](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/acra/guides/integrating-acra-server-into-infrastructure/).

## 1. Installation

Client-side encryption and Acra-side decryption: data is encrypted on the application side and decrypted on the AcraServer:
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cossacklabs/acra-engineering-demo/master/run.sh | \
    bash -s -- django
```

This command downloads the code of Django website example, Acra Docker containers, PostgreSQL database, Prometheus,
Grafana, pgAdmin images and sets up the environment, configures Django application to encrypt data, and provides a list of links for you to try.

## 2. What's inside

**The client application** is the famous Django app example â€“ the source code of [djangoproject.com](https://www.djangoproject.com/). We've [updated their source code](https://github.com/cossacklabs/djangoproject.com) to protect blog posts. Application stores blog posts in PosgtreSQL database. We encrypt blog posts' content before storing in database, and decrypt when reading from database.

Django app **encrypts** the sensitive fields of blog posts into separate AcraStructs (author name, author email, content are encrypted; blog post ID and title are in plaintext).

Django app writes AcraStructs to the database and **reads the decrypted posts** through AcraServer (which pretends to be a database).

From the users' perspective, the website works as it used to. However, the blog posts are protected now.

### 2.1 Update etc/hosts

Please add a temporary entry to the hosts file:

```bash
echo "$SERVER_IP www.djangoproject.example" >> /etc/hosts
```

where `SERVER_IP` is the IP address of the server that is running the Acra Engineering Demo (if you run the demo on your machine, set it to `127.0.0.1`). Updating the hosts file is required because we will run the protected djangoproject site locally. You can remove this line when you stop needed to access the demo site.

### 2.2 Add a new post

1. Log into admin cabinet [http://www.djangoproject.example:8000/admin/blog/entry/](http://www.djangoproject.example:8000/admin/blog/entry/) using user/password: `admin/admin`. Add a blog post to the Blogs/Entries:

2. Open the blog posts' feed [http://www.djangoproject.example:8000/weblog/](http://www.djangoproject.example:8000/weblog/) and see your fresh post.

### 2.3 Connect to the database from the web

Everything worked well! Now, let's check the content of the database.

Log into the web PostgreSQL interface [http://www.djangoproject.example:8008](http://www.djangoproject.example:8008) using user/password: `test@test.test`/`test`. Find your blog post in  `Servers > postgresql > databases > djangoproject > Schemas > public > Tables > blog_entries` and open context menu with right-click. Select `View/Edit Data > All rows` and now you can see content of the table. Download and read the content â€“ it's encrypted.

So, the blog posts are stored encrypted, but it's transparent for site visitors and admins.

### 2.4 Check the monitoring

Open Grafana dashboards to see the performance stats of AcraServer. We collect following metrics: the number of decrypted cryptographic containers (AcraStructs and AcraBlocks), request and response processing time.

Grafana is available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### 2.5 View traces

AcraServer can export detailed traces to Jaeger. Use this data to optimize the performance of the entire system.

Jaeger is available at [http://localhost:16686](http://localhost:16686).

### 2.6 Other available resources

There's more to explore:

1. PostgreSQL â€“ connect directly to the database using the admin account `postgres/test`: [postgresql://localhost:5432](postgresql://localhost:5432).

2. pgAdmin - connect directly to the database using WebUI and user account `login:test@test.test`/`password:test`: [http://localhost:8008](http://localhost:8008)

3. Prometheus â€“  examine the collected metrics: [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090).

4. Grafana â€“ see the dashboards with Acra metrics: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

5. Jaeger â€“ view traces: [http://localhost:16686](http://localhost:16686).

6. [Docker-compose.django.yml](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra-engineering-demo/blob/master/django/docker-compose.django.yml) file â€“ read details about configuration and containers used in this example.

## 3. Show me the code!

So, was it easy to integrate Acra into Django application? Sure it was!

You can [compare our repo to the original repo](https://github.com/django/djangoproject.com/compare/master...cossacklabs:master) and see how few changes we introduced:

1. We've added Acra storage public key ([L278](https://github.com/django/djangoproject.com/compare/master...cossacklabs:master#diff-6bcf911294def277f06abfe682ce5d7bR278)) necessary for AcraWriter to encrypt the data:
```
ACRA_SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY = b64decode(SECRETS.get('acra_storage_public_key'))
```

2. We added AcraWriter as a dependency and wrapped the original fields with it:

```python
import acrawriter.django

summary = acrawriter.django.TextField()
summary_html = acrawriter.django.TextField()
body = acrawriter.django.TextField()
body_html = acrawriter.django.TextField()
author = acrawriter.django.CharField(max_length=100)
```

3. We've also [run a database migration](https://github.com/django/djangoproject.com/compare/master...cossacklabs:master#diff-677329e0253d6cbba693e1ae0deda5b6) that changed the fields' format from `string` to `binary` to store the encrypted data.

Those are all the code changes! ðŸŽ‰
